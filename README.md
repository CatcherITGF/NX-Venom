# NX Venom

![Banner](banner.jpg)

The project is being developed for informational purposes showing the capabilities of the Switch hardware and is not aimed at extracting commercial benefits.

## Warning

**ATTENTION! Overclocking the console does not lead to irreversible consequences, however it poses a risk to data due to the features of Horizon OS. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use overclocking exclusively in emuMMC and make backups. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Installation

1. Make backup and delete everything except `Nintendo` and `emuMMC` folders on the SD card.
2. Unpack the [NX Venom](https://github.com/CatcherITGF/NX-Venom/raw/main/NXVenom.zip) to the root of the SD card. Use a card reader, or `Hekate` → `Tools` → `USB Tools`.
3. Use the `All-in-One Switch Updater` homebrew application for updates. The answer to "Do you want to overwrite existing .ini config" is `YES`.
4. Installation of additional software, as well as patches for games, is done through the `Uberhand` menu (click `right`) → `Software Installer`.

## How to use

1. Opening the `Uberhand` menu (as well as exiting the `Status Monitor`) by a combination `ZR + ZL + Down`.
2. Use the `sys-clk-oc` overlay to manage overclocking clocks.
3. Use the `SC Wizard` (go to the `Uberhand` menu, press the `right` button) to change the parameters of the loading kip (only for advanced users).
4. There is a built-in help inside each parameter, to access it press `Y`.
5. The lower the acceleration parameters, the safer and the fewer side effects. Use wisely!
6. Recommended overclocking parameters for handheld mode and battery life: CPU `1020 - 1428`, GPU `768 - 921`, Mem Max.

## HomeBrew Menu

To launch HomeBrew apps open the Album or any game icon whilst holding the `R` button. You can also install a forwarder application via `DBI`: [download](https://github.com/CatcherITGF/NX-Venom/raw/main/Sources/Tools/Apps/hbmenu_%5B0104444444440000%5D.nsp) (use this app ONLY in EmuMMC).

## Philosophy

The rule by which you need to be guided using console overclocking is the absence of side effects. The console should work without atmosphere errors, game crashes, shutdown due to overheating. Having achieved this result, you get a stable console, high performance in games and balanced power consumption.
